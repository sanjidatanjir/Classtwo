    <p style="text-align=justify;"> Hrithik Roshan is an Indian actor who appears in Bollywood films. He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won many awards, including six Filmfares, four for Best Actor and one each for Best Debut and Best Actor (Critics). Starting in 2012, he appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 based on his income and popularity.

        Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.

        The 2003 science fiction film <span style="font-size:20px;color: white;background-color: black;">Koi... Mil Gaya</span>, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in his career; he also appeared in its sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in the 2006 adventure film Dhoom 2, Mughal emperor Akbar in the 2008 historical romance Jodhaa Akbar and a quadriplegic in the 2010 drama Guzaarish. He played the lead in the 2011 drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 revenge film Agneepath, the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, the 2019 biopic Super 30, and the 2019 action thriller War. The lattermost ranks as his highest-grossing release.

        Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with Just Dance (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to Sussanne Khan, with whom he has two children.

    <p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Early-life & Background</strong></p><br>
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align=justify;">Roshan was born on 10 January 1974 in Bombay to a family prominent in Bollywood.[1] He is of Punjabi and Bengali descent on his paternal side. Hrithik's paternal grandmother Ira was a Bengali. His father, film director Rakesh Roshan, is the son of music director Roshanlal Nagrath; his mother, Pinky, is the daughter of producer and director J. Om Prakash. His uncle, Rajesh, is a music composer.[1] Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the Bombay Scottish School.[5] Although Roshan practices Hinduism,[6] he says that "I'm not religious. I don't visit temples. But I hope there is a superpower.Roshan felt isolated as a child; he was born with an extra thumb fused to the one on his right hand, which led some of his peers to avoid him.[9] He has stammered since the age of six; this caused him problems at school, and he feigned injury and illness to avoid oral tests.[10] He was helped by daily speech therapy.[10][11]

        Roshan's grandfather, Prakash first brought him on-screen at the age of six in the film Aasha (1980); he danced in a song enacted by Jeetendra, for which Prakash paid him ₹100. Roshan made uncredited appearances in various family film projects, including his father's production Aap Ke Deewane (1980). In Prakash's Aas Paas (1981), he appeared in the song "Shehar Main Charcha Hai".[14] The actor's only speaking role during this period came when he was 12; he was seen as Govinda, the title character's adopted son, in Prakash's Bhagwaan Dada (1986).[15][16] Roshan decided that he wanted to be a full-time actor, but his father insisted that he focus on his studies.[16] In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with scoliosis that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated,[17][18] he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he took a chance by jogging on a beach when he was caught in a downpour. There was no pain, and becoming more confident, he was able to increase his pace with no adverse effects. Roshan sees this day as "the turning point of [his] life."[17]

        Roshan attended Sydenham College, where he took part in dance and music festivals while studying, graduating in commerce.[1] Roshan assisted his father on four films—Khudgarz (1987), King Uncle (1993), Karan Arjun (1995) and Koyla (1997)—while also sweeping the floor and making tea for the crew. After pack-up, Roshan would enact Shah Rukh Khan's scenes from Koyla and film himself to make a judgement about his performance as an actor. While he assisted his father, he studied acting under Kishore Namit Kapoor.

Despite their religious difference—Roshan is a Hindu and Khan is a Muslim—Roshan says that he equally valued her beliefs.The couple has two sons, Hrehaan (born in 2006) and Hridhaan (born in 2008).They separated in December 2013 and their divorce was finalised in November 2014.

            Roshan and Sussanne maintained that they parted amicably.In 2016, he filed a lawsuit against his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut, accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover up their affair. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.

            Roshan considered quitting the film industry after two assailants fired bullets at his father in 2000. Later that December, he was involved in a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of stating in a Star Plus interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence. Nepalese people threatened to "bury [him] alive" if he ever visited the country. Star Plus, for its part, stated that Roshan "did not touch upon Nepal." The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country. Nepali actress Manisha Koirala helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station.Roshan is vocal about his childhood stammer.[137] He actively supports the Dilkhush Special School for mentally challenged children in Mumbai.[138] In 2008, he donated ₹2 million (US$28,000) to the Nanavati Hospital for the treatment of stammering children.[11] Roshan set up a charity foundation in 2009 that aims to work for handicapped people.[139] He donates roughly ₹700,000 (US$9,800) for charity every month,[140] and believes that people should publicise their philanthropic work to set an example for others.[138] In 2013, he took part in a festivity at Ghatkopar, whose proceeds went to an NGO supporting tribal girls suffering from malnutrition and starvation.[141] Also that year, he donated ₹2.5 million (US$35,000) to help the victims of the 2013 North India floods.[142]

            Alongside other Bollywood stars, Roshan played a football match for charity organised by Aamir Khan's daughter, Ira, in 2014.[143] The following year, he appeared with Sonam Kapoor in the music video for "Dheere Dheere", whose profits were donated to charity.[144] Later that year, Roshan became the Indian brand ambassador for UNICEF and the Global Goals campaign's World's Largest Lesson that aims to educate children in over 100 countries about the Sustainable Development Goals.[145] In 2016, Roshan and other Bollywood actors made donations for building homes for families affected by the 2015 South Indian floods.[146]
